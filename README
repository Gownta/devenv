Notes

1. Configuring iTerm2 and tmux

I want to send hex codes to tmux using iterm keyboard shortcuts.
In profile>keys, override command-[number] to Send Hex Code 0x02 0x3[number].
Also need to remove command-number override in general>keys>navigation shortcuts
Also add command-` to 0x02 0x3b, which is 'ctrl-b ;', which changes panes
