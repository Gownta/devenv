Notes
=====

1. Configuring iTerm2 and tmux

I want to send hex codes to tmux using iterm keyboard shortcuts.
In profile>keys, override command-[number] to Send Hex Code 0x02 0x3[number].
Also need to remove command-number override in general>keys>navigation shortcuts
Also add command-` to 0x02 0x3b, which is 'ctrl-b ;', which changes panes


2. devservers

To clone from FBDev: git clone ssh://git@github.com/Gownta/dotfiles
                     (this is the SSH url provided on github.com)
To commit from FBDev: generate an access token from Seetings > Applications
                      use this token as my password
                      git push origin master


Things to install
=================

Not dotfiles, but stuff that I also set up on new machines:

  https://docs.bazel.build
  --prefix=$HOME/dev/bazel, instead of --use
